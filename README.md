A discord bot that I spent too much time on rather than putting that time and effort into school.


# Dependencies

Discord - pip3 install discord
PyNacl - pip3 install PyNacl
youtube_dl - pip3 install youtube_dl


# How to Run

Replace the key in bot.py and go to command prompt. Then run python3 bot.py once in the directory.

# Final Words

I genuinely would not clone this repository as it has terrible variable names, redefinitions, useless functions, useless imports, duplicated variables, hacky methods to return a value that has long been implemented as a part of discord.py or discord.js for that matter. It is originally not meant to be cloned for other uses but hey, atleast it worked for me.
